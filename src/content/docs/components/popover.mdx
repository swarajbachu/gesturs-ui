| trigger                      | `string`                        | —               | The name of the component that triggered the popover. This is reflected on the element as the data-trigger attribute, and can be used to provide specific styles for the popover depending on which element triggered it.               |
| triggerRef                   | `RefObject<Element>`            | —               | The ref for the element which the popover positions itself with respect to. When used within a trigger component such as DialogTrigger, MenuTrigger, Select, etc., this is set automatically. It is only required when used standalone. |
| isEntering                   | `boolean`                       | —               | Whether the popover is currently performing an entry animation.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| isExiting                    | `boolean`                       | —               | Whether the popover is currently performing an exit animation.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| UNSTABLE_portalContainer     | `Element`                       | `document.body` | The container element in which the overlay portal will be placed. This may have unknown behavior depending on where it is portalled to.                                                                                                 |
| offset                       | `number`                        | `8`             | The additional offset applied along the main axis between the element and its anchor element.                                                                                                                                           |
| placement                    | `Placement`                     | `bottom`        | The placement of the element with respect to its anchor element.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| containerPadding             | `number`                        | `12`            | The placement padding that should be applied between the element and its surrounding container.                                                                                                                                         |
| crossOffset                  | `number`                        | `0`             | The additional offset applied along the cross axis between the element and its anchor element.                                                                                                                                          |
| shouldFlip                   | `boolean`                       | `true`          | Whether the element should flip its orientation (e.g. top to bottom or left to right) when there is insufficient room for it to render completely.                                                                                      |
| isNonModal                   | `boolean`                       | —               | Whether the popover is non-modal, i.e. elements outside the popover may be interacted with by assistive technologies. Most popovers should not use this option as it may negatively impact the screen reader experience.                |
| isKeyboardDismissDisabled    | `boolean`                       | `false`         | Whether pressing the escape key to close the popover should be disabled. Most popovers should not use this option. When set to true, an alternative way to close the popover with a keyboard must be provided.                          |
| shouldCloseOnInteractOutside | `(element: Element) => boolean` | —               | When user interacts with the argument element outside of the popover ref, return true if onClose should be called. This gives you a chance to filter out interaction with elements that should not dismiss the popover.                 |
| boundaryElement              | `Element`                       | `document.body` | Element that serves as the positioning boundary.                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| shouldUpdatePosition         | `boolean`                       | `true`          | Whether the overlay should update its position automatically.                                                                                                                                                                           |
