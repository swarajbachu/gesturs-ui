## Usage

### CardHeader

### CardContent and CardFooter

CardContent is a simple component that is used to display content in the card, it has basic padding and margin to give a good look

CardFooter is a simple component that is used to display footer in the card, it has same padding as CardContent, but doesnt have top padding ( because the card content have `p-6`, it will give enough `white-space` for footer), so it can be used to display footer in the card

Here is a demo of a simple `card with content`
